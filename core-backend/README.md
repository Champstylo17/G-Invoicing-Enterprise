# G-Invoicing Enterprise Platform

This enterprise-grade G-Invoicing platform is fully structured for modular three-tier deployment and compatible with multiple environments including GitHub, Vercel, CodeSandbox, Docker, and Visual Studio Code.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `apps/` — frontend (React, static) and backend (API)
- `core/` — business logic, data dictionary, audit, tagging, notifications
- `financials/` — payments, ledger, reconciliation, tracking
- `integration/` — external services (Stripe, Salesforce, QuickBooks, etc.)
- `infra/` — Docker, Terraform, Helm, CI/CD, monitoring
- `database/` — schema, seeds, migrations, warehouse
- `docs/` — guides, compliance, diagrams, API specs
- `.github/` — GitHub Actions workflows
- `.devcontainer/` — Visual Studio Code remote environment
- `vercel.json` — Vercel config
- `sandbox.config.json` — CodeSandbox config
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
- `package.json` — Node starter (if frontend applies)

---

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### 1. **GitHub + GitHub Actions**
CI/CD pipeline enabled via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/g-invoicing
# Push commits to trigger CI/CD
```

---

### 2. **Vercel**
Vercel will use `vercel.json` to deploy the frontend or static assets.
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel
vercel deploy
```

---

### 3. **CodeSandbox**
Recognizes `sandbox.config.json` and `index.html` entry.
```txt
Upload folder → CodeSandbox dashboard → Auto-deploys as static project
```

---

### 4. **Visual Studio Code**
Supports DevContainers.
```bash
# Open in VS Code → Reopen in Container
.devcontainer/devcontainer.json is preconfigured
```

---

### 5. **Docker / Compose**
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

---

### 6. **Python API Backend (Flask)**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

---

### 📌 Notes
- Update `package.json` or `requirements.txt` with real dependencies.
- All folders are modular. Replace stubs with real logic.
